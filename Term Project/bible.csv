GEN/2:5,GEN,1,2,5,"and no shrub of the field is yet in the earth, and no herb of the field yet sprouteth, for Yahweh God hath not rained upon the earth, and a man there is not to serve the ground,"

GEN/3:10,GEN,1,3,10,"and he saith, `Thy sound I have heard in the garden, and I am afraid, for I am naked, and I hide myself.'"

GEN/3:17,GEN,1,3,17,"And to the man He said, `Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and dost eat of the tree concerning which I have charged thee, saying, Thou dost not eat of it, cursed  the ground on thine account; in sorrow thou dost eat of it all days of thy life,"
GEN/3:18,GEN,1,3,18,"and thorn and bramble it doth bring forth to thee, and thou hast eaten the herb of the field;"
GEN/3:19,GEN,1,3,19,"by the sweat of thy face thou dost eat bread till thy return unto the ground, for out of it hast thou been taken, for dust thou `art', and unto dust thou turnest back.'"

GEN/3:22,GEN,1,3,22,"And Yahweh God saith, `Lo, the man was as one of Us, as to the knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he send forth his hand, and have taken also of the tree of life, and eaten, and lived to the age,' --"
GEN/3:23,GEN,1,3,23,Yahweh God sendeth him forth from the garden of Eden to serve the ground from which he hath been taken;
GEN/3:24,GEN,1,3,24,"yea, he casteth out the man, and causeth to dwell at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubs and the flame of the sword which is turning itself round to guard the way of the tree of life."

GEN/4:2,GEN,1,4,2,"and she addeth to bear his brother, even Abel. And Abel is feeding a flock, and Cain hath been servant of the ground."
GEN/4:3,GEN,1,4,3,And it cometh to pass at the end of days that Cain bringeth from the fruit of the ground a present to Yahweh;
GEN/4:4,GEN,1,4,4,"and Abel, he hath brought, he also, from the female firstlings of his flock, even from their fat ones; and Yahweh looketh unto Abel and unto his present,"
GEN/4:5,GEN,1,4,5,"and unto Cain and unto his present He hath not looked; and it is very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance is fallen."
GEN/4:6,GEN,1,4,6,"And Yahweh saith unto Cain, `Why hast thou displeasure? and why hath thy countenance fallen?"
GEN/4:7,GEN,1,4,7,"Is there not, if thou dost well, acceptance? and if thou dost not well, at the opening a sin-offering is crouching, and unto thee its desire, and thou rulest over it.'"

GEN/4:10,GEN,1,4,10,"And He saith, `What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood is crying unto Me from the ground;"
GEN/4:11,GEN,1,4,11,"and now, cursed `art' thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy hand;"
GEN/4:12,GEN,1,4,12,"when thou tillest the ground, it doth not add to give its strength to thee -- a wanderer, even a trembling one, thou art in the earth.'"
GEN/4:13,GEN,1,4,13,"And Cain saith unto Yahweh, `Greater is my punishment than to be borne;"
GEN/4:14,GEN,1,4,14,"lo, Thou hast driven me to-day from off the face of the ground, and from Thy face I am hid; and I have been a wanderer, even a trembling one, in the earth, and it hath been -- every one finding me doth slay me.'"
GEN/4:15,GEN,1,4,15,"And Yahweh saith to him, `Therefore -- of any slayer of Cain sevenfold it is required;' and Yahweh setteth to Cain a token that none finding him doth slay him."

GEN/30:34,GEN,1,30,34,"And Laban saith, `Lo, O that it were according to thy word;'"
GEN/30:35,GEN,1,30,35,"and he turneth aside during that day the ring-straked and the spotted he-goats, and all the speckled and the spotted she-goats, every one that `hath' white in it, and every brown one among the lambs, and he giveth into the hand of his sons,"
GEN/30:36,GEN,1,30,36,and setteth a journey of three days between himself and Jacob; and Jacob is feeding the rest of the flock of Laban.
GEN/30:37,GEN,1,30,37,"And Jacob taketh to himself a rod of fresh poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut, and doth peel in them white peelings, making bare the white that  on the rods,"
GEN/30:38,GEN,1,30,38,"and setteth up the rods which he hath peeled in the gutters in the watering troughs (when the flock cometh in to drink), over-against the flock, that they may conceive in their coming in to drink;"
GEN/30:39,GEN,1,30,39,"and the flocks conceive at the rods, and the flock beareth ring-straked, speckled, and spotted ones."
GEN/30:40,GEN,1,30,40,"And the lambs hath Jacob parted, and he putteth the face of the flock towards the ring-straked, also all the brown in the flock of Laban, and he setteth his own droves by themselves, and hath not set them near Laban's flock."
GEN/30:41,GEN,1,30,41,"And it hath come to pass whenever the strong ones of the flock conceive, that Jacob set the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, to cause them to conceive by the rods,"
GEN/30:42,GEN,1,30,42,"and when the flock is feeble, he doth not set `them'; and the feeble ones have been Laban's, and the strong ones Jacob's."
GEN/30:43,GEN,1,30,43,"And the man increaseth very exceedingly, and hath many flocks, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses."

GEN/31:2,GEN,1,31,2,"and Jacob seeth the face of Laban, and lo, it is not with him as heretofore."
GEN/31:3,GEN,1,31,3,"And Yahweh saith unto Jacob, `Turn back unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I am with thee.'"
GEN/31:4,GEN,1,31,4,And Jacob sendeth and calleth for Rachel and for Leah to the field unto his flock;
GEN/31:5,GEN,1,31,5,"and saith to them, `I am beholding your father's face -- that it is not towards me as heretofore, and the God of my father hath been with me,"
GEN/31:6,GEN,1,31,6,"and ye -- ye have known that with all my power I have served your father,"
GEN/31:7,GEN,1,31,7,"and your father hath played upon me, and hath changed my hire ten times; and God hath not suffered him to do evil with me."
GEN/31:8,GEN,1,31,8,"`If he say thus: The speckled are thy hire, then bare all the flock speckled ones; and if he say thus: The ring-straked are thy hire, then bare all the flock ring-straked;"
GEN/31:9,GEN,1,31,9,"and God taketh away the substance of your father, and doth give to me."
GEN/31:10,GEN,1,31,10,"`And it cometh to pass at the time of the flock conceiving, that I lift up mine eyes and see in a dream, and lo, the he-goats, which are going up on the flock, `are' ring-straked, speckled, and grisled;"
GEN/31:11,GEN,1,31,11,"and the messenger of God saith unto me in the dream, Jacob, and I say, Here `am' I."
GEN/31:12,GEN,1,31,12,"`And He saith, Lift up, I pray thee, thine eyes, and see -- all the he-goats which are going up on the flock `are' ring-straked, speckled, and grisled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to thee;"
GEN/31:13,GEN,1,31,13,"I `am' the God of Bethel where thou hast anointed a standing pillar, where thou hast vowed a vow to me; now, arise, go out from this land, and turn back unto the land of thy birth.'"
GEN/31:14,GEN,1,31,14,"And Rachel answereth -- Leah also -- and saith to him, `Have we yet a portion and inheritance in the house of our father?"
GEN/31:15,GEN,1,31,15,"have we not been reckoned strangers to him? for he hath sold us, and he also utterly consumeth our money;"
GEN/31:16,GEN,1,31,16,"for all the wealth which God hath taken away from our father, it  ours, and our children's; and now, all that God hath said unto thee -- do.'"
GEN/31:17,GEN,1,31,17,"And Jacob riseth, and lifteth up his sons and his wives on the camels,"
GEN/31:18,GEN,1,31,18,"and leadeth all his cattle, and all his substance which he hath acquired, the cattle of his getting, which he hath acquired in Padan-Aram, to go unto Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan."
GEN/31:19,GEN,1,31,19,"And Laban hath gone to shear his flock, and Rachel stealeth the teraphim which her father hath;"
GEN/31:20,GEN,1,31,20,"and Jacob deceiveth the heart of Laban the Aramaean, because he hath not declared to him that he is fleeing;"
GEN/31:21,GEN,1,31,21,"and he fleeth, he and all that he hath, and riseth, and passeth over the River, and setteth his face `toward' the mount of Gilead."
GEN/31:22,GEN,1,31,22,"And it is told to Laban on the third day that Jacob hath fled,"
GEN/31:23,GEN,1,31,23,"and he taketh his brethren with him, and pursueth after him a journey of seven days, and overtaketh him in the mount of Gilead."
GEN/31:24,GEN,1,31,24,"And God cometh in unto Laban the Aramaean in a dream of the night, and saith to him, `Take heed to thyself lest thou speak with Jacob from good unto evil.'"
GEN/31:25,GEN,1,31,25,And Laban overtaketh Jacob; and Jacob hath fixed his tent in the mount; and Laban with his brethren have fixed `theirs' in the mount of Gilead.
GEN/31:26,GEN,1,31,26,"And Laban saith to Jacob, `What hast thou done that thou dost deceive my heart, and lead away my daughters as captives of the sword?"
GEN/31:27,GEN,1,31,27,"Why hast thou hidden thyself to flee, and deceivest me, and hast not declared to me, and I send thee away with joy and with songs, with tabret and with harp,"
GEN/31:28,GEN,1,31,28,and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? -- now thou hast acted foolishly in doing `so';
GEN/31:29,GEN,1,31,29,"my hand is to God to do evil with you, but the God of your father yesternight hath spoken unto me, saying, Take heed to thyself from speaking with Jacob from good unto evil."
GEN/31:30,GEN,1,31,30,"`And now, thou hast certainly gone, because thou hast been very desirous for the house of thy father; why hast thou stolen my gods?'"
GEN/31:31,GEN,1,31,31,"And Jacob answereth and saith to Laban, `Because I was afraid, for I said, Lest thou take violently away thy daughters from me;"
GEN/31:32,GEN,1,31,32,"with whomsoever thou findest thy gods -- he doth not live; before our brethren discern for thyself what  with me, and take to thyself:' and Jacob hath not known that Rachel hath stolen them."
GEN/31:33,GEN,1,31,33,"And Laban goeth into the tent of Jacob, and into the tent of Leah, and into the tent of the two handmaidens, and hath not found; and he goeth out from the tent of Leah, and goeth into the tent of Rachel."
GEN/31:34,GEN,1,31,34,"And Rachel hath taken the teraphim, and putteth them in the furniture of the camel, and sitteth upon them; and Laban feeleth all the tent, and hath not found;"
GEN/31:35,GEN,1,31,35,"and she saith unto her father, `Let it not be displeasing in the eyes of my lord that I am not able to rise at thy presence, for the way of women  on me;' and he searcheth, and hath not found the teraphim."
GEN/31:36,GEN,1,31,36,"And it is displeasing to Jacob, and he striveth with Laban; and Jacob answereth and saith to Laban, `What  my transgression? what my sin, that thou hast burned after me?"
GEN/31:37,GEN,1,31,37,"for thou hast felt all my vessels: what hast thou found of all the vessels of thy house? set here before my brethren, and thy brethren, and they decide between us both."
GEN/31:38,GEN,1,31,38,"`These twenty years I `am' with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not miscarried, and the rams of thy flock I have not eaten;"

GEN/31:43,GEN,1,31,43,"And Laban answereth and saith unto Jacob, `The daughters `are' my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the flock my flock, and all that thou art seeing  mine; and to my daughters -- what do I to these to-day, or to their sons whom they have born?"
GEN/31:44,GEN,1,31,44,"and now, come, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and it hath been for a witness between me and thee.'"
GEN/31:45,GEN,1,31,45,"And Jacob taketh a stone, and lifteth it up `for' a standing pillar;"

GEN/44:6,GEN,1,44,6,"And he overtaketh them, and speaketh unto them these words,"
GEN/44:7,GEN,1,44,7,"and they say unto him, `Why doth my lord speak according to these words? far be it from thy servants to do according to this word;"
GEN/44:8,GEN,1,44,8,"lo, the money which we found in the mouth of our bags we brought back unto thee from the land of Canaan, and how do we steal from the house of thy lord silver or gold?"
GEN/44:9,GEN,1,44,9,"with whomsoever of thy servants it is found, he hath died, and we also are to my lord for servants.'"
GEN/44:10,GEN,1,44,10,"And he saith, `Now, also, according to your words, so it ; he with whom it is found becometh my servant, and ye are acquitted;'"
