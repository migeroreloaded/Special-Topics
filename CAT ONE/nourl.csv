Devices turn on in an instant and are always up-to-date. You can multitask quickly and move effortlessly between applications, collaborate wirelessly in a high quality videoconference - all with the convenience of longer battery life. Plus, you can guard against identity theft and ensure safe access to your network with built-in security features. In fact, the only thing more amazing than an Intel Core processor-based PC is what your users will do with it. The standard configuration of T440 includes 2 x 3-cell batteries, one internal and one swappable. Power Bridge allows you to swap the rear battery without powering down your system. This is much needed for long flights or travellers who are away from power sources for an extended period of time and can give you up to 17 hours of use without needing to plug in. A VGA port for projector connections in conference rooms is still a business must-have, and a native VGA means no dongles to buy/lose/replace. Dolby Advanced Audio is a suite of audio technologies that enable your ThinkPad to deliver a crisp, clear surround sound experience over its built-in stereo speakers. The technology increases audio clarity for VOIP applications, maximizes volume output without distortion, and improves dialogue clarity when watching videos. Crystal clear video, face tracking and keystroke noise suppression technology will help you web conference or chat like you're really there. Dual digital array microphones ensure a premium audio experience. Assure worry-free enjoyment of your T440 with accidental damage protection, which keeps you covered in the event of accidental damage - such as drops or spills - that occur under normal working conditions.","Lenovo Lenovo T440 14-inch ThinkPad  (Intel Core I5 1.6 GHz Processor, 4 GB RAM, 500 GB HDD, With Bag+Wireless Mouse",Lenovo,,,#142200
